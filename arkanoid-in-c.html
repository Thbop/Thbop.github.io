<h3>Introduction</h3>
<i>This tutorial is a continuation of my <a href="c-for-python-programmers.html">previous C tutorial</a>.</i>

<p>
    Today we are going to flexing our C skills to make the very simple game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid" target="_blank">Arkanoid</a>.
    We will also cover basic graphics using the <a href="https://www.raylib.com/" target="_blank">raylib</a> framework. You can view the finished project <a href="https://github.com/thbop/Arkanoid/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>
    Before we get started, let's start with some theory.
    First, in graphics coordinates work similar to reading text on a page, they start at the top left corner and increase going down right the screen.
</p>

<p>In otherwords, the window's origin is at the top left corner. Going right means increasing x and going down means increasing y.</p>

<h3>Installing Raylib</h3>

<p>
    Raylib is a very easy-to-setup framework for game or UI development. It comes ready with many <a href="https://www.raylib.com/examples.html" target="_blank">examples</a>
    and a handy <a href="https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html" target="_blank">cheatsheet</a>. You can also find additional support at their <a href="https://discord.gg/raylib" target="_blank">discord server</a>.
</p>

<p>
    To download it, head over to its <a href="https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib" target="_blank">itch download page</a>, donate or just go to downloads (it's free!), and run the installer.
</p>

<p>It should install (if you are on Windows) on your C drive included with a compiler and other tools.</p>

<p>Depending on your setup, I'd reccomend adding the binary directory (<code class="magenta">C:\raylib\w64devkit\bin</code>) to PATH (Windows only). If you are confused about this, I would honestly just recommend you lookup how to add directories to PATH.</p>

<p>To set up our project navigate to the projects directory (<code class="magenta">C:\raylib\raylib\projects</code>) and choose the project for your favorite editor; for this tutorial, I am using VSCode.</p>

<p>Copy the template and delete (for VSCode) <code class="magenta">/resources</code>, <code class="magenta">main.code-workspace</code>, and <code class="magenta">Makefile.Android</code> (none of these are needed).</p>

<p>Press <code class="magenta">CTRL-F5</code> in VSCode and you should see this:</p>

<img src="https://github.com/thbop/thbop.github.io/blob/main/images/Arkanoid/default-app.png?raw=true" />

<p>Before proceeding, I'd also recommend commenting out "<code class="magenta">-Wl,--subsystem,windows</code>" on the <code class="magenta">CFLAGS</code> line in the <code class="magenta">Makefile</code> (as of now, line 210). This will allow you to print to console and view the application's runtime debug information.</p>

<h3>Starter Template</h3>

<p>
    Getting started in a new graphics library is easiest when you can get straight to drawing, not dealing with repetitive window management.
    Here's a basic template crafted just for this project. I would not recommend using this template for a large project, as you should understand a large portion of a library
    before starting a big project.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">#include "raylib.h"
#include "raymath.h"
#include "string.h" // We'll be using this later
#include "stdio.h" // Just in case if you want to use printf or other I/O functions; helpful for debugging

// Create a type symbol for unsigned characters; I use this mostly as a boolean
typedef unsigned char u8;

void update() {

}

void draw() {

}

int main() {
    InitWindow( WIDTH, HEIGHT, "Arkanoid" );
    SetTargetFPS(60);

    while(!WindowShouldClose()) {
        update();

        BeginDrawing();
            ClearBackground(BLACK);
            draw();
        EndDrawing();
    }

    CloseWindow();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
