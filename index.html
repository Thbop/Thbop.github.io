<h5><i>I decided to act like I don't know any CSS (or HTML for that matter) and make my website like more classy developers.</i></h5>
<p>Software and video game developer. You can check out my github <a href="https://github.com/thbop/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Minecraft</h2>
<p>I do have some old projects available on <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/thbop/" target="_blank">PMC</a>.</p>
<p>I have more recently worked on a public server called Thbopica. You can join (or start it up) at <code class="magenta">thbopica.minefort.com</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>I publish my video games on itch.io, here's <a href="https://thbop.itch.io/" target="_blank">my page</a>.</p>
<p>Most of my projects were coded in python and packaged with pyinstaller; thus, your computer will probably think they are viruses, but you could just run the source code if that makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Current titles:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://thbop.itch.io/pineapple" target="_blank">Pineapple</a> <--- An actually good game</li>
    <li><a href="https://thbop.itch.io/pigeon" target="_blank">Pigeon</a> <--- Like flappy bird, but worse</li>
    <li><a href="https://thbop.itch.io/interplanetary-orbital-simulation" target="_blank">Interplanetary Orbital Simulation</a> <--- IOS for short; not really a game, but still cool.</li>
    <li><a href="https://thbop.itch.io/boring-pong" target="_blank">Boring Pong</a> <--- Just pong, made with raylib as my first C project. Lack of OOP was painful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have more games, these are just the ones that have taken the most time to create.</p>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thbop/6502/main/misc/grid.gif" />
<p>Check out my (in progress) 6502 emulator <a href="https://github.com/thbop/6502" target="_blank">here</a>. During the course of this project, I accidentally learned some 6502 assembly while exploring low level architecture.</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>I've pretty much done a lot of very dumb things in the realm of graphics, slowly improving over time.</p>
<p>I've tried Peter Shirley's <i><a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html" target="_blank">Ray Tracing in One Weekend </a></i> book and made this in Python:</p>
<img src="https://github.com/thbop/Ray-Tracing/blob/main/out.png?raw=true" width="400px" />
<h5><i>And yes, I had to look up how to remove that nasty image interpolation</i></h5>
<p>From this project I have gained the knowledge that it is not smart to write a raytracer in Python.</p>
<p>In fact though, it is fairly fun and difficult to create a <a href="https://github.com/thbop/RawCpp3D" target="_blank">3D renderer purely in C++</a>:</p>
<img src="https://github.com/thbop/RawCpp3D/raw/main/showcase/render1.png" />
<h5><i>The hardest bit was definitely the triangle rasterization, because I did not know what I was doing...</i></h5>
<p>Also, along the lines of that renderer, <a href="https://github.com/thbop/Lambert" target="_blank">obsessing over Lambertian Diffuse is not uncommon</a>.</p>
<p>It seems like my graphics section is fairly large. I hope that does not make a statement. I might need to dedicate a page purely to graphics in the future...</p>
