<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>C is a compiled low-level language first developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">source</a>).</p>

<p>As a Python programmer, you are used to a language developed by <a href="https://gvanrossum.github.io/">Guido van Rossum</a>. Python was coded in C++, an almost extension of C (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">source</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, Python is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">Interpreted Language</a>, parsing instructions line by line opposed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">Compiled Language</a>.</p>

<p>
    Thus, as previously stated, Python is a high-level programming language (far abstracted from raw machine code) while C is a low-level programming language.
    Furthermore, as a C programmer, you can expect to be far-removed from the high-level features of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented Programming</a>.
</p>

<p>In C, one primarily and fundamentally deals with raw numbers and memory addresses. High-level features such as strings, lists, dictionaries and the like do not exist and must be coded from scratch.</p>

<p>
    To compile C programs you, of course, will need a compiler. For general purpose projects I'd use <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/">mingw-w64</a>, specifically <i>i686-w64-mingw32</i>.
    Mingw-w64 is packaged with a ton of tools and installing it can be tricky for beginners, but it allows one to write C and C++ programs. 
</p>

<p>
    For this tutorial, I'll be using the <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">Tiny C Compiler</a> due to its small size and ease of use.
    I specifically downloaded <i>tcc-0.9.27-win32-bin</i> since I am on Windows 10. Don't stress to much between 32 bit versus 64 bit (unless, of course, you are running a 32 bit operating system).
</p>

<p>Since tcc (Tiny C Compiler) is much simpler than gcc (one of mingw-w64's compilers), the resulting file size is very tiny. We're talking 2KB versus 240KB just for a simple "Hello World!" program.</p>

<p>(Note: For windows users, I'd recommend adding tcc to PATH; if you do not know what that means, you probably aren't experienced enough in Python to be following this tutorial.)</p>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>

<p>A basic "Hello World!" program looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a line-by-line explanation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> - <a href="https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/">preprocessor directive</a> functioning similar to an <code>import</code> statement in Python code.
        "std" means standard, "io" means input/output, and ".h" means it is a header file. "stdio.h" contains functions for standard input/output, like <code>printf()</code>.
        <b>Preprocessor statements do not end with semicolons.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">int main {</code> - defines the program entry point. Unlike Python, to run any code in C you must define a main function; additionally, this function must return an integer (the <code>int</code>).
        The returned <code>int</code> signals to the operating system the success or failure of your program. 0 = success while 1 = failure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">printf("Hello World!\n");</code> - prints a character array to the console. The "f" in <code>printf()</code> stands for formatted (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10761713/what-is-the-meaning-of-f-in-printf">source</a>).
        Notice also how the line is terminated with a semicolon; this simply tells the compiler this line is finished (not the invisible newline [or '\n'] character that Python uses).
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">return 0;</code> - simply returns 0 denoting to the system that the program ran successfully.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">}</code> - end bracket to define the end of the <code>main()</code> function. Brackets are nested like indentation in Python. Furthermore, C does not rely on indentation at all (a valid program can consist on a single line).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To compile this "Hello World!" program, first create a text file named: "main.c". Unlike Java (and similar languages) the name of the .c source file does not correspond to the name of the <code>main()</code> function. You can name your file whatever you want as long as it ends in ".c".</p>

<p>Using tcc in the console, run <code>tcc main.c</code>. A main.exe (windows) should be generated. Here's a windows example:</p>

<pre><code class="magenta">C:\Users\thbop\Desktop>tcc main.c

C:\Users\thbop\Desktop>main
Hello World!

C:\Users\thbop\Desktop>main.exe
Hello World!

</code></pre>

<p>One benefit, made immediately apparent when using a compiled language, is that users downloading a program do not need a "compiler" (or "interpreter") to run it; their machine already knows how to run it.</p>

<p><i>Unfortunately, writing takes time. Time I do not have and thus you are left with an incomplete tutorial.</i></p>

<h3>Theory Dump: How It Works with cc65</h3>

<p>C Compilers basically convert C code to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a>, assemble it into an object file (".o"), and finally link it into a machine code.</p>

<p>For this theory dump, I'll show the entire process for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502 Processor</a>, an older and (relatively) simpler processor compared to modern processors. (6502 assembly is also much simpler to understand compared to modern assembly.)</p>

<p>First, before we get into it, you will have to understand the elementary concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">Byte</a>. (Simple explanation: 8 bits, 1 bit is an on or off state.)</p>

<p>For this walk-through, I'll be using this program:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">// We do not #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; because the 6502 is just a processor; there is no standard defined input/output.
unsigned char main() {
    unsigned char i = 0;
    while ( i &lt; 10 ) {
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: <code class="magenta">unsigned char</code> declares that variable's / function's type as an unsigned (no negative sign, only positive) character (1 byte). You can think of it as a variable that can only store values from 0 to 255 (range of 2^8=256).</p>

<p>Aside from that no-so-obvious (for some) note, this program is relatively simple and its Python equivalent is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">i = 0
while i &lt; 10:
    i += 1
</code></pre>

<p>The abridged 6502 assembly source file (compiled by <a href="https://cc65.github.io/">cc65</a>) looks like this (with comments added):</p>

<pre><code class="language-asm6502">.segment	"CODE"

	lda     #$00        ; Loads a 0 into the A register; the A register or Accumulator is general purpose single-byte storage in the CPU
	jsr     pusha       ; Pushes A onto the stack (I'll cover the stack later)
	jmp     L0004       ; Jumps to the while loop (the assembly line starting with "L0004:")
L0002:	ldy     #$00    ; This is the "i++" expression within the while loop
	ldx     #$00
	clc
	lda     #$01        ; Loads 1 into A so that we can add it to the C variable "i"
	adc     (sp),y      ; Adds A + i
	sta     (sp),y      ; Stores the result in i. After processing this line, the CPU will go to the next line (L0004)
L0004:	ldy     #$00    ; Start of the while loop line
	ldx     #$00
	lda     (sp),y      ; Loads the value of i into A
	cmp     #$0A        ; Compares A to 0A (hex representation of 10)
	jsr     boolult     ; Jumps to the boolult subroutine to handle the "<" sign
	jne     L0002       ; If the comparison is is satisfied (e.g. A is less than 10), jump to L0002
	ldx     #$00        ; When the CPU is on this instruction, the while loop has finished and everything just needs to be cleaned up.
	lda     #$00
	jmp     L0001       ; Jump to L0001
L0001:	jsr     incsp1
	rts                 ; Return from program. This processor can only run one program at a time, so we need to be able to return.
