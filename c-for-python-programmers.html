<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>C is a compiled low-level language first developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">source</a>).</p>

<p>As a Python programmer, you are used to a language developed by <a href="https://gvanrossum.github.io/">Guido van Rossum</a>. Python was coded in C++, an almost extension of C (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">source</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, Python is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">Interpreted Language</a>, parsing instructions line by line opposed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">Compiled Language</a>.</p>

<p>
    Thus, as previously stated, Python is a high-level programming language (far abstracted from raw machine code) while C is a low-level programming language.
    Furthermore, as a C programmer, you can expect to be far-removed from the high-level features of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented Programming</a>.
</p>

<p>In C, one primarily and fundamentally deals with raw numbers and memory addresses. High-level features such as strings, lists, dictionaries and the like do not exist and must be coded from scratch.</p>

<p>
    To compile C programs you, of course, will need a compiler. For general purpose projects I'd use <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/">mingw-w64</a>, specifically <i>i686-w64-mingw32</i>.
    Mingw-w64 is packaged with a ton of tools and installing it can be tricky for beginners, but it allows one to write C and C++ programs. 
</p>

<p>
    For this tutorial, I'll be using the <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">Tiny C Compiler</a> due to its small size and ease of use.
    I specifically downloaded <i>tcc-0.9.27-win32-bin</i> since I am on Windows 10. Don't stress to much between 32 bit versus 64 bit (unless, of course, you are running a 32 bit operating system).
</p>

<p>Since tcc (Tiny C Compiler) is much simpler than gcc (one of mingw-w64's compilers), the resulting file size is very tiny. We're talking 2KB versus 240KB just for a simple "Hello World!" program.</p>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>

<p>A basic "Hello World!" program looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a line-by-line explanation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> - <a href="https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/">preprocessor directive</a> functioning similar to an <code>import</code> statement in Python code.
        "std" means standard, "io" means input/output, and ".h" means it is a header file. "stdio.h" contains functions for standard input/output, like <code>printf()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">int main {</code> - defines the program entry point. Unlike Python, to run any code in C you must define a main function; additionally, this function must return an integer (the <code>int</code>).
        The returned <code>int</code> signals to the operating system the success or failure of your program. 0 = success while 1 = failure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">printf("Hello World!\n");</code> - prints a character array to the console. The "f" in <code>printf()</code> stands for formatted (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10761713/what-is-the-meaning-of-f-in-printf">source</a>).
        Notice also how the line is terminated with a semicolon; this simply tells the compiler this line is finished (not the invisible newline [or '\n'] character that Python uses).
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">return 0;</code> - simply returns 0 denoting to the system that the program ran successfully.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">}</code> - end bracket to define the end of the <code>main()</code> function. Brackets are nested like indentation in Python. Furthermore, C does not rely on indentation at all (a valid program can consist on a single line).
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Unfortunately, writing takes time. Time I do not have and thus you are left with an incomplete tutorial.</i></p>
