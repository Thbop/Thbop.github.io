<h3>Introduction</h3>
<i>This tutorial is a continuation of my <a href="c-for-python-programmers.html">previous C tutorial</a>.</i>

<p>
    Today we are going to flexing our C skills to make the very simple game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid">Arkanoid</a>.
    We will also cover basic graphics using the <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> framework.

<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>
    Before we get started, let's start with some theory.

<p>In otherwords, the window's origin is at the top left corner. Going right means increasing x and going down means increasing y.</p>
